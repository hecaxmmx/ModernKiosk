# ModernKiosk

Kiosk-like WebExtension for modern browers like Firefox, Chrome, Opera, etc.

Steps to run:

 * install the extension. Available for [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/modern-kiosk/)
 * see the [rounded-square icon](icons/ModernKiosk.svg) on the browser
 * browse to the URL that you want as the default kiosk URL
 * right-click on the icon and select "Set as the kiosk URL"
 * right click and select on "Enter kiosk mode" to start in that URL in full screen

To exit, quit the browser.

We will add more functionality later to further prevent access to the OS.
